# Network Protocol Stack:

OSI (7 layer): Application→ Presentation→ Session→ Transport→ Network → Data Link Layer → Physical

⇒ For TCP, Application+ Presentation+ Session combined as application layer

TCP/IP (5 layer) : Application→ Transport→ Network → Data Link Layer → Physical

Application: email service, chat service

Transport: Divide big chunks of data into smaller chunks and manage

Network : How routing of packets will be done in network

Data Link Layer: error/ flow control, multiplexing, handle addressing

Physical: data converting into signal and transfer through wires, satellites etc.

# Application Layer

Roles:

⇒ Writing / Providing data off to the network

⇒ Reading the data from user

⇒ Contains applications that helps users to interact on the network.

⇒ Error handling or recovery can also be done

## Where it exists?

⇒ end systems ex: phone, laptop

⇒ Instant messaging (WhatsApp, www, VOIP, email)
